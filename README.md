Features
-

* Multi-touch pinch zoom
* Double-tap zoom
* Smooth zooming and scrolling, using animation thread
* All in one class
* Easy to put in a scrolling parent, like the ViewPager (example provided)



Examples
-
This project provides two examples:

* Simple use of ImageViewZoom in [OneImageSampleActivity](https://github.com/tenthbitinc/ZoomImageView/blob/master/src/com/tenthbit/zoomimageview/sample/OneImageSampleActivity.java "OneImageSampleActivity")
* Use of ImageViewZoom with ViewPager in [ViewPagerSampleActivity](https://github.com/tenthbitinc/ZoomImageView/blob/master/src/com/tenthbit/zoomimageview/sample/ViewPagerSampleActivity.java "ViewPagerSampleActivity")

Origin
-
This project is based on the excellent [PhotoView](https://github.com/chrisbanes/PhotoView "PhotoView") by Chris Banes.
Many thanks to Chris for writing it.

Improvements over PhotoView:
- The library has been simplified from seven files to just one.
- Fixed pinch zoom accuracy, also with multiple fingers.
- Some parts of code have been removed, rewritten and overall simplified.
